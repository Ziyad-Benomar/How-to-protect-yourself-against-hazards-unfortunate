# How to protect yourself against unfortunate hazards
(Apr - Jul 2019)
modeling of the arrival of random events by a Poisson process and study of its properties.  
Ruin theory is considered a branch of risk management in insurance. This corresponds to the study of the probability that an adverse event will occur for an insured under an insurance contract.  
These accidents therefore involve risks that the insurer must assess in order to pay indemnities to the insured.  
We typically model an accident as a (negative) jump in the insurer's wealth. In a first part, we analyze the modeling of accidents assimilated to jump processes. Then, we will extend this study to the modeling of the total cost related to these accidents.  
Finally, we will see how to calibrate the initial reserve of the insurance company in order to minimize its probability of ruin: the probability that its wealth becomes negative.
